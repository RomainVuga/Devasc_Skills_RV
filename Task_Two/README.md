Task 2 -- Github Skills Test


Preparation:
Review earlier tasks during the course.
Open the VM and Virtual Router.

Step 1: Create a host file
Re-used code from old tasks.

Step 2: Create a config file
Re-used code from old tasks.

Step 3: Create a Ansible playbook
I used code that we used during the course.
One file contained the code for the L3 and logging buffer code, I used code from a second file for version control. The last code i added is to display the output, i used online sources.


Troubleshooting:
I had some trouble with getting the correct output.
With the use of ChatGPT I found a way.


Verification:
Do i get output with information about the IOS and L3?
Did the configuration for the logging buffer work?
