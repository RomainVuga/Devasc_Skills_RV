Devasc skills test
by Romain Vuga

There are practical tasks about the following topics:

Github
Ansible
Docker
Jenkins
Rest API & RESTCONF
Webex Teams API
Bash
Filtering DNAC Response Data


I made the choice to limit the amount of time I put into this assignment. 
I made less progress in the other course and wanted to put more time into the Network Implementation course.


Completed:
Github
Ansible
Webex Teams API
Filtering DNAC Response Data

Could not complete because system problems:
Docker (could not find a solution)
Jenkins (can not launch)

No progress:
Rest API & RESTCONF
Bash
