Task 3 -- Github Skills Test

Preparation:
Open the Devasc VM
Followed this resource for the Apache part https://hub.docker.com/_/httpd


Implementation:
Step 1:
Create a HTML file with a custom layout.
Used ChatGPT for the current time in HTML.

Step 2:
Create a custom style with CSS.

Step 3:
Create a Dockerfile.

Step 4:
Build image and start container.


Troubleshooting:
I wasn’t able to make the container work.
I kept getting the error "unable to create worker thread" & “Could not reliably determine the server’s fully qualified domain name”..
Tried a simple html page, but nothing worked.
After some research on ChatGPT and Google I gave up.


Verification:
Open the page in a web browser and enter the following in the terminal “docker container ls”.
